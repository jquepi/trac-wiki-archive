= DVCS Workflows =

Twisted is developed in a Subversion repository, but there is no reason you can't take advantage of your favorite DVCS toolchain to contribute and submit patches.

Keep in mind that unless you are a core committer, your interaction with svn basically boils down to:

{{{
#!sh
# Checkout trunk
svn co svn://svn.twistedmatrix.com/svn/Twisted/trunk twisted-trunk

# Create patches
svn diff > mypatch.patch

# Keeping up-to-date with trunk:
svn up
}}}

How you choose to manage your local repository is up to you, but here are a few workflows to help:

== Bazaar ==
[[Image()]]
The Twisted codebase is mirrored into a set of Bazaar branches, making it easy to work on trunk or any existing branches.

See: [wiki:BazaarMirror Bazaar Workflow]


== Git ==
[[Image()]]
There is an official Git mirror.

See: [wiki:GitMirror Git Workflow]

== Mercurial ==
[[Image()]]
There are no official Mercurial mirrors. One recommended method is to use the Mercurial MQ extension.
