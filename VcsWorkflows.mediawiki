[[PageOutline(2-3, , inline)]]

Twisted is developed in a Subversion repository, but there is no reason you can't take advantage of your favorite DVCS toolchain to contribute and submit patches.

Keep in mind that unless you are a core committer, your interaction with svn basically boils down to:

{{{
#!sh
# Checkout trunk
svn co svn://svn.twistedmatrix.com/svn/Twisted/trunk twisted-trunk

# Create patches at the *root* or your checkout (the folder with "twisted", "bin", "doc", etc.)
cd twisted-trunk; svn diff > mypatch.patch

# Keeping up-to-date with trunk:
svn up
}}}


== Bazaar ==

The Twisted codebase is mirrored into a set of Bazaar branches, making it easy to work on trunk or any existing branches.

See: [wiki:BazaarMirror Bazaar Workflow]


== Git ==

There is an official Git mirror.

See: [wiki:GitMirror Git Workflow]

== Mercurial ==

There are no official Mercurial mirrors. One recommended method is to use the Mercurial MQ extension.
