= Building Twisted on Windows =

== OVERVIEW ==

Some requirements must be met to build the "Official" win32 Twisted.

=== Installation requirements ===

* Install packages mentioned in [https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/trunk/INSTALL.rst#installation-requirements Installation requirements]
* You must install the exact version of the MSVC compiler which matches you Python version: [https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers]

=== Building ===

Just issue the command:
{{{
$ python setup.py bdist_wheel
}}}


== OFFICIAL ==

The Official Twisted is built with native Python 2.7 (latest), not the
Cygwin version of Python, however it is built with the help of Cygwin
packages.

 You need both.


 * Zope``Interface 3.3.0

 Download and install it for both versions of Python.


 * winreg

 You need this little module:  http://www.rutherfurd.net/python/winreg/



== TROUBLESHOOTING ==
If you have trouble building the official build, try the following:
 1. Make sure your cygwin .bash_profile isn't clobbering this system PATH
 2. Make sure you don't have Cygwin's Python package installed. 
 3. If you're doing an official release, see maintainer-notes.txt.
