= Building Twisted on Windows =

== OVERVIEW ==

Some requirements must be met to build the "Official" win32 Twisted.

=== Installation requirements ===

* Install packages mentioned in [https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/trunk/INSTALL.rst#installation-requirements Installation requirements]

=== With MSVC ===
Without Cygwin installed, you need MSVC installed for the cl.exe
compiler, which is the default on windows.  Just issue the command:
{{{
$ python setup.py bdist_wheel
}}}

=== With Mingw ===
The easiest way to build the extensions without MSVC is to install MinGW, for example using the [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&package_id=240780 automated installer].
Then, create a distutils.cfg file in your distutils installation path (for example, C:\Python2.5\Lib\distutils\distutils.cfg), and put the following content:
{{{
[build]
compiler=mingw32
}}}

And then issue {{{$ python setup.py install}}}. You can also pass the {{{--compiler=mingw32}}} option to the build command instead of using distutils.cfg.


=== With Cygwin ===
With Cygwin installed, you need to make sure these two packages are installed:
  - gcc
  - gcc-mingw

Once that's done, just issue the command:

{{{
python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32 install
}}}

If for some reason extensions won't build, try this instead:

{{{
python setup.py build_py build_scripts install --skip-build
}}}


== OFFICIAL ==

The Official Twisted is built with native Python 2.7 (latest), not the
Cygwin version of Python, however it is built with the help of Cygwin
packages.

 You need both.


 * Zope``Interface 3.3.0

 Download and install it for both versions of Python.


 * winreg

 You need this little module:  http://www.rutherfurd.net/python/winreg/


 * Cygwin

 You will need Cygwin, with the gcc-mingw package installed.  Get Cygwin at: http://cygwin.com

 DO NOT INSTALL CYGWIN PYTHON!

 DO NOT INSTALL CYGWIN PYTHON!

 (Install Native Windows Python.)


 * Inno Setup

 This creates nice self-installers with uninstall functionality:  http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

 You need version 4.0.8 or above.  (5.0.8 or later preferred.)


 * Bootstrap Twisted

 You will need an existing installation of Twisted, as the build script uses some utilities within Twisted.  The "bare minimum" install described above will suffice.


== TROUBLESHOOTING ==
If you have trouble building the official build, try the following:
 1. Make sure your cygwin .bash_profile isn't clobbering this system PATH
 2. Make sure you don't have Cygwin's Python package installed. 
 3. If you're doing an official release, see maintainer-notes.txt.
