People have posted elsewhere about their PyCon sprint experience, maybe?

 * [http://hg.python.org/peps/file/tip/pep-0469.txt PEP 469], ''Migration of dict iteration code to Python 3'', acknowledges “Thanks to the folks at the Twisted sprint table at PyCon for a very vigorous discussion of this idea (and several other topics).”
