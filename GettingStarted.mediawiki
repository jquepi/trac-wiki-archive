= Where To Start =

So you're already [wiki:WhyShouldICare excited about about Twisted], but you don't know how to get going?  You've come to the right place.

The first thing you need to learn about if you're thinking about using Twisted is Deferreds.  This is the way Twisted does concurrency allowing your program to handle multiple users while using a single process and thread.

= Do Something With Twisted =

Now that you understand the base idea that drives Twisted, let's build a somewhat useful application.

= Learn More About Twisted =

Okay, you're now knowledgeable enough to be dangerous.  Time to delve in further into the APIs.

 * [http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/ API Documentation] - This is the full API documentation for Twisted
 * [http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.internet.interfaces.html Twisted.Internet.Interfaces] - This is a collection of interfaces that are core to Twisted
