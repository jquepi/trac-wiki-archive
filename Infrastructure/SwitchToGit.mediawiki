= To do list for switching the code repository from Subversion to Git =

''This acts more as a reminder of things to do than the actual definitive list. Feel free to update it if things are missing.''

Changing the repository must still meet the [wiki:WorkflowRequirements workflow requirements].

 * Changes to the infrastructure should be made against the [https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid braid repository] (or its sub-modules) so that it can be deployed with `fab`
 * Upgrade Trac:
   * It's old and needs Git support for:
     * be able to browse the repository
     * detect ticket references and ticket closures from Git commits messages

   Starting from Trac 1.0, Git is supported out of the box, see http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracGit
   * See current works on [wiki:Infrastructure/UpgradingTrac upgrading Trac].
 * The CI system already uses Git. Is there any changes to make here?
 * Port the post-commit hooks from Subversion to Git:
   * IRC announcements from Kenaan
   * repository structure enforcement (i.e. no merges to trunk, or, presumably, "master", without a fixed bug and a NEWS file, unless it's a quote file change)
   * Buildbot kick off (Is it already done?)
 * [ticket:7035 Port the release scripts from Subversion to Git: #7035]
 * [ticket:7036 Port twisted.python.versions to use Git: #7036]
 * Is there any need to have a Git mirror on the same machine as Trac?
   * we don't want our release repository on the same machine running the website.  (code.twistedmatrix.com has a much smaller attack surface)
