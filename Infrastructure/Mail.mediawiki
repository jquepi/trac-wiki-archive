We would eventually like twistedmatrix.com mail to be self hosting with twisted.mail.

The requirements we have
 1. Mailing list hosting using mailman.
 2. Delivery of local mail. This is primarily for trac.
 3. Forwarding of mail for aliases on twistedmatrix.com.
 4. Delivery of outgoing mail for authorized users. This would be a prerequesite for doing things like setting SPF.
 
There is currently some (untested) code to interact with mailman and greylistd at 
[https://github.com/twisted-infra/t-mail].

Other implementations:
 * [https://github.com/oubiwann/txMailServer txMailServer]
 * [https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~divmod-dev/divmod.org/trunk/view/head:/Quotient/README.txt Quotient] (particularly [https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~divmod-dev/divmod.org/trunk/view/head:/Quotient/xquotient/mail.py xquotient.mail] I think)
