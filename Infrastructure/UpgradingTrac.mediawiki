Some notes on what whill be required to upgrade trac:

{{{
#!sh
trac-admin config/trac-env/ upgrade
trac-admin config/trac-env/ wiki upgrade

# I'm not sure where, or how much of the generated stuff we need.
# Some of this probably needs to be put in t-web/trac-files
trac-admin config/trac-env/ deploy ????

# I haven't tried this, since the server I tested on doesn't have a copy of the appropriate svn repo.
trac-admin /path/to/projenv repository resync '*'
}}}

 1. `/trac/reports` - The new formatting has lots of junk.
 2. Our custom template in `t-web/trac-files/templates/site.html` is incompatible.
    * The ticket page won't display.
    * The `WikiStart` page has an annoying `wiki:WikiStart` in the upper left hand corner. (and every other page)
      This is probably just that the appropriate css classes changed?
 3. Reports my need updating to reflect microsecond timestamps ([http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracUpgrade#Microsecondtimestamps see the upgrade guide])
 4. Possibly remove prermission:
{{{
#!sh
for perm in BROWSER_VIEW CHANGESET_VIEW FILE_VIEW LOG_VIEW; do
    trac-admin config/trac-env permission remove $perm
done
}}}
    ([http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracUpgrade#Authzpermissionchecking reference])
 5. Updates post-commit hook. See [http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracRepositoryAdmin#Synchronization here] and [http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracWorkflow#Howtocombinethetracopt.ticket.commit_updaterwiththetestingworkflow here].
