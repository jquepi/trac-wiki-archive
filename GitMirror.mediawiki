A Git mirror of the entire Twisted repository is available.

= Checking out =

{{{
git clone http://svn.twistedmatrix.com/git/Twisted/.git
}}}

Note that even if you have Twisted commit access, you can't create or merge branches this way - you must use SVN directly, make your own Git mirror with `git svn`, or obtain a copy (not a clone) of such a Git mirror. If you do choose to make your own Git mirror with `git svn`, it takes about a week to import the entire Twisted commit history.

= Git isn't ignoring .pyc files! =

There is no `.gitignore` in the repository.  This is intentional - there's [http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/policy/coding-standard.html#auto25 no svn:ignore properties in the official SVN repository either] - on the grounds that different people might want to ignore different things. Instead, you can tell Git to ignore things by adding rules to the `.git/info/exclude` file. Here's an example:
{{{
*~
*.py[co]
_trial_temp
dropin.cache
*.o
*.lo
*.la
}}}
See [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitignore.html the Git documentation on .gitignore], particularly ''core.excludesfile'', for more information.

= git svn operations seem to take forever =

If you have your own `git svn` clone, and svn-based operations seem to take forever, try running:
{{{
git svn info
}}}
If that takes longer than 30 seconds to run, and eventually prints an error message, this is a clue that `git svn` has gotten confused about how your current branch connects to the imported SVN history. Either `git checkout` a git branch that's based on an SVN branch or (if you're already on such a branch, and it's broken) use `git reset some-remote-branch-name` to make sure your local branch is pointing exactly at a commit that was imported from SVN.

= git svn branching =

Follow the [http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/policy/svn-dev.html#auto6 standard Twisted branch-name conventions] when creating branches with Git. 

{{{
git svn branch new-branch-name-XXXX
git checkout -b new-branch-name-XXXX remotes/new-branch-name-XXXX
}}}
(where `XXXX` means the ticket-number in question)
