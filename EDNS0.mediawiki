An attempt to understand the pieces of EDNS0 and the changes necessary to have Twisted Names support it:

 - EDNS0
  - [ticket:5668 OPT record]
   - Explicit OPT record class/type
     - Teach cache about it - MUST NOT BE CACHED
     - Teach recursive resolver about it - MUST NOT BE FORWARDED
     - Teach loaders about - MUST NOT BE LOADED FROM MASTER FILE
   - ~~Extended label ("0" "1" type) parsing~~ (REJECTED BY 2671bis)
   - Maximum UDP datagram size field
   - Arbitrary extension support (attribute/value pairs in RDATA section)
  - Extended Message object with additional EDNS0 items
   - Subclass of Message?
   - maxSize (Message has it already, can we re-use it?)
   - Extended RCODE - partly defined by RCODE field in OPT record
  - Accept max UDP size as configuration?  determine it from system automatically?
   - Server and client need this
  - Client
   - Automatically send EDNS0 queries
   - Fall back to DNS queries when detecting server does not support EDNS0?
  - Server
   - Send EDNS0 responses to EDNS0 queries
   - (Do not send EDNS0 responses to DNS queries)
 - DNSSEC
  - ??????
