== Reviewing and Adding Documentation ==

Some reasons the documentation need help include if:
 * the explanations are unclear
 * the examples don't work or have become outdated
 * the overall structure or the order in which information is presented is unintuitive 
 * examples for major concepts are missing

Note that the example and howto documentation on the website may be outdated, as they are only updated from trunk on releases.

=== Editing example and howto documentation ===

1. if you haven't already, [wiki:TwistedDevelopment#Creatingyourworkenvironment create your Twisted work environment].

2. make sure you have the latest version of the code

3. Edit away!

The documentation lives in [http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html reStructuredText] (`.rst`) files in subdirectories of `Twisted/docs/`. Twisted uses the document generator [https://sphinx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ sphinx] to generate the html files you see on the web from these `.rst` files. After adding your changes, it's important to review your changes for correctness and to preview how they will look on the website.

4. Previewing with sphinx

For example, if I made changes to `Twisted/docs/core/howto/choosing-reactor.rst`, I should

{{{
. build/bin/activate  # only necessary once; 'build' is the virtualenv name used on the TwistedDevelopment wiki page
python bin/admin/build-docs .
}}}

This generates `Twisted/doc/core/howto/choosing-reactor.html`, which you can view in a web browser via the URL

`file:///path/to/Twisted/doc/core/howto/choosing-reactor.html`

If everything looks good, submit a patch to the `.rst` as described [wiki:TwistedDevelopment#SubmittingaPatch here].

=== Editing API Docs ===

The API docs are generated from the doc strings in the code by [https://github.com/twisted/pydoctor pydoctor], so to update what will be displayed in the API docs just update the doc strings. After making your changes, generate a test set of API docs to preview how they will look.

1. if you haven't already, [wiki:TwistedDevelopment#Creatingyourworkenvironment create your Twisted work environment].

2. make sure you have the latest version of the code

3. Edit away! Be sure to adhere to the docstring guidelines in the [https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/policy/ Twisted coding standard].

4. Preview your changes

Generate the docs with the build-apidocs admin script like so:

{{{
. build/bin/activate  # only necessary once; 'build' is the virtualenv name used on the TwistedDevelopment wiki page
python bin/admin/build-apidocs src apidocs
}}}

The above produces a folder called `apidocs` in your current working directory. You can then browse from the entry points to the docs in a web browser via the URL

`file:///path/to/apidocs/index.html`

If everything looks good, submit a patch as described [wiki:TwistedDevelopment#SubmittingaPatch here].
