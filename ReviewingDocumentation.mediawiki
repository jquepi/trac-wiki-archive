== Reviewing and Adding Documentation ==

The documentation may need help if:
 * Explanations are unclear
 * Examples don't work or have become outdated
 * The overall structure or the order in which information is presented is unintuitive 
 * Examples for major concepts are missing

Note that the [https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/index.html example and howto documentation on the website] may be outdated, as it is only updated from trunk on releases. The [https://twisted.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ latest build on Read the Docs reflects current trunk].

=== Editing example and howto documentation ===

These narrative docs live in [http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html reStructuredText] (`.rst`) files in subdirectories of [https://github.com/twisted/twisted/tree/trunk/docs docs/]. Twisted uses the document generator [https://sphinx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ Sphinx] to generate the HTML files you see on the web from these `.rst` files. After adding your changes, it's important to review your changes for correctness and to preview how they will look on the website.

1. If you haven't already, [wiki:TwistedDevelopment#Creatingyourworkenvironment create your Twisted work environment].

2. Make sure you have the latest version of the code

3. Edit away!

4. Preview your changes with Sphinx

For example, if I made changes to `docs/core/howto/choosing-reactor.rst`, I should

{{{
tox -e narrativedocs
}}}

This generates `docs/_build/core/howto/choosing-reactor.html`, which you can view in a web browser with the command:

{{{
python -m webbrowser docs/_build/core/howto/choosing-reactor.html
}}}

If everything looks good, submit a patch to the `.rst` as described [wiki:TwistedDevelopment#SubmittingaPatch here].

=== Editing API Docs ===

The API docs are generated from the doc strings in the code by [https://github.com/twisted/pydoctor pydoctor], so to update what will be displayed in the API docs just update the doc strings. After making your changes, generate a test set of API docs to preview how they will look.

1. If you haven't already, [wiki:TwistedDevelopment#Creatingyourworkenvironment create your Twisted work environment].

2. Make sure you have the latest version of the code

3. Edit away! Be sure to adhere to the docstring guidelines in the [https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/policy/ Twisted coding standard].

4. Preview your changes with pydoctor

Generate the docs with the build-apidocs admin script like so:

{{{
tox -e apidocs
}}}

The above produces a folder called `apidocs` in your current working directory. You can then open the docs in a web browser with the command:

{{{
python -m webbrowser apidocs/index.html
}}}

If everything looks good, submit a patch as described [wiki:TwistedDevelopment#SubmittingaPatch here].
