== Contributing ==

If you want to work on Twisted, check out this URL:
{{{
svn://svn.twistedmatrix.com/svn/Twisted/trunk
}}}
Generate patches via editing your checkout of trunk and running 'svn diff' at the ''root'' of your checkout - the folder with "twisted", "bin", "doc", etc. in it.

Make sure that you have written unit tests and docstrings for all code which has changed in your patch.  For more details about what will be considered an acceptable patch, see the "Development Process" section below.

Attach the output of 'svn diff' to a ticket in the tracker and assign it the 'review' keyword so that a core developer will notice it and review it.  Don't be discouraged if it is not immediately accepted!  To keep the quality of Twisted high, almost all patches are rejected on their initial submission.  Check back to see if the patch has been re-assigned to you for further work.

Finally, if your patch is good, it will be applied to trunk and included as part of the next release.

If you are interested in contributing to Twisted for the first time, consider working on an existing ticket rather than contributing a new feature.  Fixes for existing problems or implementations of already-requested features will generally take priority over new ideas.

== Buildbot ==

After every commit to Twisted, the buildbot runs all the unit tests and reports [http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/ test results on several platforms].  Here is a page showing only the [http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/supported test results on supported platforms]. All tests on supported platforms always pass. Watch the buildbot. Because sometimes, the buildbot watches back.

== Development Process ==

Twisted uses same process as Divmod: [http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/UltimateQualityDevelopmentSystem The Ultimate Quality Development System], in addition to this ReviewProcess. If you don't have commit access to Twisted, please submit changesets in diff -u format to the [http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/newticket ticket tracker]. To submit tickets, you must first [http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/register register].

If you want to become a developer, it is important to understand that all your contributions (including those initial patches you send to the bug tracker) will have to be licenced under the [http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php MIT licence].

== Win32 development ==

If you want to hack Twisted or just use Twisted SVN on Win32, see Ying Li's [http://cyli.livejournal.com/22274.html short tutorial on setting up a Twisted win32 development environment] (and a [http://cyli.livejournal.com/22921.html small addendum on paths]).
