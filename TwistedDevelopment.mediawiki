== General Info ==

See the TwistedProject page for info on the SVN repository. After every commit to Twisted, the [http://twistedmatrix.com/buildbot/ Buildbot] runs all the unit tests on several separate machines on a few different platforms, and reports the status of those tests. Watch the buildbot. Because sometimes, the buildbot watches back.

== Development Process ==

Twisted uses same process as Divmod: [http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/UltimateQualityDevelopmentSystem The Ultimate Quality Development System], in addition to this ReviewProcess. If you don't have commit access to Twisted, please submit changesets in diff -u format to the [http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/newticket ticket tracker]. To submit tickets, you must first [http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/register register].

If you want to become a developer, it is important to understand that all your contributions (including those initial patches you send to the bug tracker) will have to be licenced under the [http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php MIT licence].
