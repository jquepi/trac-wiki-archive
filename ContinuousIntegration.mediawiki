=== Software ===

Twisted's continuous integration solution is BuildBot.

=== Configuration ===

==== Test Suite ====

The slaves connecting to Twisted's BuildBot master run in a variety of platforms.  These platforms determine what the ''supported'' configurations of Twisted are.

==== Code Coverage ====

As well as running the Twisted test suite, BuildBot also runs coverage reporting tools to generate reports of how much of Twisted is covered by its test suite.  The [wiki:ContinuousIntegration/CoverageSlaveConfiguration configuration] for these slaves is similar to that of normal test slaves, but there are a couple extra dependencies.

==== Documentation ====

BuildBot also generates Twisted's API and howto-style documentation.  These development snapshots are available for people looking for the most bleeding edge Twisted documentation.
