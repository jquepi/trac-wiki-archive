= Documentation Analysis =

The '''documentation analyis''' is the work of the January 14 2006 twisted documentation sprint.

== Overview ==

This sprint will hopefully be the first in a series, and it will be
focussed on ''reading'' the documentation, rather than writing it. We
would therefore especially welcome the input of people who are either
users of the documentation, or want the documentation improved but don't
want to write it.

We will focus on reviewing present documentation against the following
criteria:
 * does it reflect best practices for Twisted coders?
 * is it up-to-date?
 * is it complete?

For people who are newer to Twisted, reviews on the general useability
of any particular piece of Twisted documentation as per my post at
http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2005-May/010386.html
