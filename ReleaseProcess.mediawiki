'''This document is a draft'''

= How to do a pre-release =

 1. File a ticket (e.g. #4290)
 1. Check [http://twistedmatrix.com/boxes-supported buildbot] to make sure all supported platforms are green (wait for pending builds if necessary).
 1. Make a branch (e.g. `mkbranch Twisted release-4290`)
 1. Run `./bin/admin/change-versions XX.YY.ZZpreN`
 1. Commit the changes made by `change-versions`
 1. Run `./bin/admin/build-news .`
 1. Commit the changes made by `build-news`
 1. Make a temporary directory for the tarballs to live in (e.g. `mkdir /tmp/twisted-release`)
 1. Run `./bin/admin/build-tarballs . /tmp/twisted-release/`
 1. Upload the tarballs to a public website
 1. Announce the pre-release on
    1. the twisted-python [wiki:TwistedCommunity#MailLists mailing list]
    1. on IRC in the #twisted topic
    1. in a blog post, ideally `labs.twistedmatrix.com`


== Open questions ==

 * How do I decide the version number?
 * Do we need to commit the changes from `build-news` for pre-releases?
   * They leave the pre-release version in the NEWS files when doing pre-releases
   * But build-tarballs won't work with uncommitted changes
 * How do we manage the case where there are untested builds in trunk?
 * How/when in this process are the Windows installers and/or MacOS .dmg files created? See #3279.
   * (I presume .deb and .rpm packages are left up to Linux distro packagers)
 * How/when in this process are the docs built?
 * When should the front page of the wiki be updated?

== Notes ==

 * Test `change-versions` with pre-releases
 * There should be a template for release announcements
   * Pre-release announcements should include an exhortation to test
   * Release announcements should include actual NEWS summaries and maybe a pointer to the full thing
 * There are missing scripts:
   * for uploading pre-release tarballs
     * Need a standard place to upload tarballs
   * for signing tarballs
   * for uploading release tarballs
 * It would be nice if the news fragments contained information about who made the changes

== Suggestions for additions to pre-release steps ==

 * pick a release quote :)
 * bump copyrights in [source:trunk/LICENSE], [source:trunk/twisted/_version.py] and [source:trunk/README]
 * Delete the news `NNNN.bugfix` etc files after building [source:trunk/NEWS]
 * Check the milestone for the upcoming release, get rid of any non-critical bugs
 * Check for any open tickets marked regressions, get them fixed
 * A thought for future releases: since we'd really like folks to download the prereleases and try them out, perhaps we should put the [source:trunk/NEWS NEWS] file on the web somewhere official, too, so they can see all the cool stuff they can try out?
   * "Other fixes" and maybe all tickets should be links when they are on the web
 * Document how and when to tag releases in SVN.
 * Read through the NEWS files and write a summary of the interesting changes for the release
 * Read the INSTALL file, check the required Python version. If it mentions supported platforms, check that the list matches the current set of buildbots.
 * Get cube access

== For the release itself ==

 * Remove the 'pre'
   * So tedious! Write a tool to do this.
   * XXX: File a bug
   * `find . -type f -not -path '*.svn*' -not -name '*~' | xargs grep -n 'pre2'`
 * Add the quote of the release
 * Get the branch reviewed
 * Tag the branch
   * XXX: How do I do this?
 * Make new tarballs
 * Build windows installers
   * http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/winxp32-py2.5-msi/
   * Branch: "branches/release-x-4290"
 * Upload to the official upload locations:
   * Prerequisites: cube account; write access to /srv/www-data/twisted/Releases/
   * <radix> jml: `cube:/srv/www-data/twisted/Releases/<Project>/<First two parts of version number>/*`
   * We hell of need a script to do this too. XXX: file a bug
 * Wait for the tarballs to be mirrored to tmrc
   * They are mirrored 15 minutes every hour
 * Update the WikiStart and [Download] pages
 * Announce more fully:
   * python-announce
   * PyPI
   * Launchpad
   * `labs.twistedmatrix.com`
   * twisted-python
   * twisted-web
 * Packaging
   * Do we need to do anything for Debian / Ubuntu?
   * OS X
     * ~~Packaging not necessary, there's no good way to make an installer that overrides the default Python~~ see #3279
     * Definitely need instructions for OS X-using developers who want to use a more recent version of Twisted
   * Win32 - see [source:trunk/win32/maintainer-notes.txt]
   * eggs?
