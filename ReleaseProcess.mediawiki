'''This document is a draft'''

= How to do a pre-release =

 1. File a ticket (e.g. #4290)
 1. Check [http://twistedmatrix.com/boxes-supported buildbot] to make sure all supported platforms are green (wait for pending builds if necessary).
 1. Make a branch (e.g. `mkbranch Twisted release-4290`)
 1. Run `./bin/admin/change-versions XX.YY.ZZpreN`
 1. Commit the changes made by `change-versions`
 1. Run `./bin/admin/build-news .`
 1. Commit the changes made by `build-news`
 1. Make a temporary directory for the tarballs to live in (e.g. `mkdir /tmp/twisted-release`)
 1. Run `./bin/admin/build-tarballs . /tmp/twisted-release/`
 1. Upload the tarballs to a public website
 1. Announce the pre-release on
    1. the twisted-python mailing list
    1. on IRC in the #twisted topic
    1. in a blog post, ideally labs.twistedmatrix.com


== Open questions ==

 * How do I decide the version number?

 * Do we need to commit the changes from `build-news` for pre-releases?
   * They leave the pre-release version in the NEWS files when doing pre-releases
   * But build-tarballs won't work with uncommitted changes

 * How do we manage the case where there are untested builds in trunk?

== Notes ==

 * Test `change-versions` with pre-releases
 * There should be a template for release announcements
   * Pre-release announcements should include an exhortation to test
   * Release announcements should include actual NEWS summaries and maybe a pointer to the full thing
 * There are missing scripts:
   * for uploading pre-release tarballs
   * for signing tarballs
   * for uploading release tarballs
