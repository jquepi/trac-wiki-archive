= Twisted Names =

Twisted Names is both a domain name server as well as a client resolver library. Twisted Names comes with an "out of the box" nameserver which can read most BIND-syntax zone files as well as a simple Python-based configuration format. Twisted Names can act as an authoritative server, perform zone transfers from a master to act as a secondary, act as a caching nameserver, or any combination of these. Twisted Names' client resolver library provides functions to query for all commonly used record types as well as a replacement for the blocking gethostbyname() function provided by the Python stdlib socket module.

Twisted Names is available under the MIT Free Software licence.
