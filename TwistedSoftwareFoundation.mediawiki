[prelim text]

== Background ==

== Goals ==

Our goals are simple: we want to be able to continue improving Twisted -- everything from specialized bug fixes to paying hosting bills -- for the benefit of the community, the users of Twisted. We want to provide sponsors with the ability to make tax-deductible donations, and we want to provide a forum where our sponsors can give voice to their own vision of how Twisted can be better.

== Sponsorship Levels ==

Below are the names and amounts associated with levels of sponsorship. 

   * Platinum: $20,000
   * Gold: $10,000
   * Silver: $1,000
   * Bronze: $500
   * Aluminum: $50

These will be used on the front page of http://twistedmatrix.com to group sponsor's logos. Sponsor logos will be sorted by time: earlier sponsors at the top.

== Sponsors ==

We are currently engaged with multiple companies/organizations, building a solid base of Founding Sponsors. Check back soon; we'll be posting information and acknowledgments here! 

== How to Donate ==

You can use the form on the front page at anytime to make a donation to the TSF! Look for the PayPal and Google Checkout "Dontate" buttons.
