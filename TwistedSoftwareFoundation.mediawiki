= Twisted Software Foundation =

The name "Twisted Software Foundation" is a reference of convenience to our legal non-profit status through the [http://conservancy.softwarefreedom.org/ Software Freedom Conservancy]. The Conservancy has allowed us to pool legal resources with other projects, such as Inkscape, Samba, and Wine, to reduce the management overhead associated with creating our own, dedicated legal entity.

== Background ==

At the end of January, 2008, the Twisted project finalized an agreement with the [http://conservancy.softwarefreedom.org/ Software Freedom Conservancy] that granted us non-profit status. For years prior to this, we had explored the options available to us for creating a foundation; due to our lack of resources, time and money, they were all prohibitively expensive. At the urging of individuals and organizations, we again explored other options. This most recent effort was a culmination of hard work over the last year between the Twisted project and the Conservancy, and we are delighted to present the results to the community: "Twisted Software Foundation".

== Goals ==

Our goals are simple: we want to be able to continue improving Twisted -- everything from specialized bug fixes to paying hosting bills -- for the benefit of the community, the users of Twisted. We want sponsors to be able to make tax-deductible donations, and we want to provide a dedicated forum (initially, a sponsors-only mail list) where our sponsors can give voice to their own vision of how Twisted can be better.

== Sponsorship Levels ==

Below are the names and amounts associated with levels of sponsorship. 

   * Platinum: $10,000
   * Gold: $5,000
   * Silver: $1,000
   * Bronze: $500
   * Aluminum: $50

These will be used on the front page of http://twistedmatrix.com/ to group sponsor's logos. Sponsor logos will be sorted by time: earlier sponsors at the top.

== Sponsors ==

We are currently engaged with multiple companies/organizations, building a solid base of [wiki:TSF/FoundingSponsors Founding Sponsors]. Check back soon!

== How to Donate ==

You can use the form on the front page at anytime to make a donation to the TSF! Look for the !PayPal and Google Checkout "Donate" buttons. These linked buttons point to the Conservancy's account for us, which is a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization. As a result, donations to Twisted are now tax-deductible.

== Acknowledgments ==

Once our founding sponsors list is complete, we will also be making acknowledgments of those who played key roles in setting up the TSF.
