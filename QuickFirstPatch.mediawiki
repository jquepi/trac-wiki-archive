   1. Go to [http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/boxes-supported?branch=trunk&num_builds=5 the latest trunk builds on buildbot]
   1. Select the latest documentation build.  That is, click on the topmost number (e.g. "16166") in the leftmost green box next to the word "documentation"
   1. Under "Steps and Logfiles", under "api-documentation", click on the link to "pydoctor errors" (or just search the page for "pydoctor errors".  That should give you a list of errors along with file names and line numbers.  ([http://bit.ly/twisted-pydoctor-errors Here is a link to the latest pydoctor errors as of 04 April 2012 22:56 -0800])
