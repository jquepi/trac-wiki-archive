= Contributing To Twisted =

There are many ways individuals and organizations can make contributions to Twisted.

Many open source projects are perpetually crunched for volunteer labor. Twisted is no different in this respect â€” we could always use more help from the community.  However, we are lucky to have something that most projects don't: the ability to convert dollars directly into maintenance that benefits the project.

When you contribute money to the Twisted project, you are directly contributing to get bugs fixed, features implemented, and tickets reviewed
Donations are [/trac/wiki/TwistedSoftwareFoundation#Background tax-deductible] and can be made via [/trac "Google Checkout or Paypal"] or directly to the [/trac/wiki/TwistedSoftwareFoundation Twisted Software Foundation].
