== Twisted Joins Software Freedom Conservancy (2008-02-07) ==

A little less than a year ago, we were approached by Erik Dahl of Zenoss
about creating a legal entity which Zenoss (and hopefully others!) could
use to donate to Twisted.  Accepting money in some official capacity
would allow us to finance things like sprints, releases, maintenance
work, dedicated reviewer time, as well as offsetting the ongoing costs
to the founders of the project such as hosting and domain registration.

It's been a long, hard road to get there, but the Twisted project has
finally, very recently joined the Software Freedom Conservancy. 

Read the full announcement [http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2008-February/016740.html here].
