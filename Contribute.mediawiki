= Contributing To Twisted (DRAFT) =

[[PageOutline(2-4)]]

This is a one page summary of the ways that you or your organization
can contribute to Twisted.

This is a draft document which is intended to eventually replace
wiki:ContributingToTwistedLabs.

== Donate ==

There are many ways individuals and organizations can make
contributions to Twisted.

Many open source projects are perpetually crunched for volunteer
labor. Twisted is no different in this respect â€” we could always use
more help from the community.  However, we are lucky to have something
that most projects don't; the ability to convert dollars directly into
maintenance that benefits the project.

When you contribute money to the Twisted project, you are directly
contributing to get bugs fixed, features implemented, and tickets
reviewed.  Donations are [wiki:TwistedSoftwareFoundation#Background
tax-deductible] and can be made via [/ "Google Checkout or Paypal"] or
directly to the [wiki:TwistedSoftwareFoundation Twisted Software Foundation].


== Report Bugs / Suggest Enhancements ==

  1. '''Search for an existing ticket''': Search the bugtracker for any existing tickets that are similar
     to the ones you are planning to file. There are three ways to
     search for existing tickets:
     * [https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site:twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket Search for tickets using Google]
       This is usually the simplest way to search, but the results
       may not include the newest tickets and will also include
       closed tickets.
     * [query:?status=!closed&order=id&desc=0&description=&summary=&component= Use the Trac ticket reporting tool]
       You can use this tool to narrow your search to open tickets
       and tickets within a particular Twisted component eg web,
       names, etc.
     * [search?q=&noquickjump=1&ticket=on Use the Trac freetext search tool].
       This tool also allows you to search for related commit messages and
       wiki pages but it the results will not be as relevant as
       Google and it also returns references to closed tickets.


  2. '''Introduce yourself''': If you didn't find an existing ticket, introduce yourself on the
     [wiki:TwistedCommunity#MailLists mailing lists] or in
     [wiki:TwistedCommunity#Real-TimeChat IRC] and discuss your proposed bug or
     enhancement with the Twisted Developers. They may be able to
     point you to an existing ticket or help you structure
     your proposed enhancement so that it can be quickly and
     efficiently integrated into Twisted.

     See the [wiki:TwistedCommunity#TwistedCommunity Twisted Community]
     page for the various ways to contact Twisted Developers.

  3. '''Register''': Before you can create a new ticket you will have
     to create an account in the Twisted Trac system. Visit the
     [/register registration page] and choose a username and password.

     '''Choose a unique password. Do not use the same
     password that you use for accessing other websites.'''

  4. '''Create a ticket''': There are three types of ticket described
     in [wiki:TwistedDevelopment#FilingTickets the FilingTickets section of the TwistedDevelopment guide].

     They are duplicated here for convenience:

       '''Enhancements''':: are used for feature additions. These
       typically take the form of a new API or an expansion of an
       existing API. Enhancement tickets should clearly describe the
       desired feature. The more well specified a feature is, the more
       likely it is to be implemented (and importantly, the more likely
       it is that what is implemented will actually be what the reporter
       wanted!) and the easier it is to implement. Remember that the
       ticket is possibly the only persistent record of the feature
       request. If it is not self-contained and sufficiently detailed,
       then it will likely fail to communicate the reporter's idea,
       diminishing its value (possibly all the way down to zero).

       '''Defects''':: are used to track bugs in existing APIs. Defect
       tickets are easier to specify than enhancements. A defect should
       briefly describe the problem, but the bulk of the ticket should
       be a runnable program (ideally in the form of a unit test) which
       demonstrates the bug.

       '''Regressions''':: are similar to defects, but are for bugs
       which are introduced into APIs in newer releases of Twisted. Like
       defect tickets, regression tickets should have a runnable program
       attached to demonstrate the problem.
