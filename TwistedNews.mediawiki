= Twisted News =

Twisted News provides a very basic NNTP server, as well as an NNTP client protocol implementation. Two messages storage systems are supported: the DB-API 2.0 backend stores and indexes messages in any compatible SQL database; the Twisted dirdbm backend uses serialized Python objects stored directly on the filesystem for message storage. Twisted News also has very rudamentary support for moderated groups.

Twisted News is available under the MIT Free Software licence.
