== Using Buildbot ==

Always run [http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com buildbot] against a branch before merging it it trunk. 

 1. Get [http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~twisted-dev/twisted-trac-integration/trunk/view/head:/tools/force-builds.py force-builds.py].
 1. Run the script on your branch with `python force-builds.py /branches/<branch name> '<Comment>'`
    * Note the forward slash before 'branches' and the lack of a forward slash after the branch name
 1. Look at the results at the URL `http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/boxes-supported?branch=/branches/<branch name>`
    * The latest trunk build can been viewed at `http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/boxes-supported?branch=/trunk`
 1. For complicated patches or ones that are likely to tickle cross-platform problems, it's useful to link to buildbot results in the ticket to show that the patch doesn't break any builds.
