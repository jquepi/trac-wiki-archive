= The Twisted Project Sponsorship Program =

We want to continue to invest in and improve Twisted -- for the benefit of our users, and the public at large.   We can't do this without the support of our sponsors and, as a project, we want to publicly acknowledge certain donations through our revamped Twisted Project Sponsorship Program.  [[BR]]
