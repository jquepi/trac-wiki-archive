= Workflow Requirements =

Here's a list (incomplete - please contribute) of things we use tools for in our development process:

 * Issue tracking
   * IRC notification of new tickets and ticket review / openness state
   * Mail notification of new tickets
   * Mail notification of subscribed tickets
   * Ability to delete comments (spam)
 * Web site
   * Must be presented via twistedmatrix.com, with a custom style sheet.
   * Browser analytics like [http://www.sitemeter.com/?a=stats&s=sm7twistedmatrix&r=19 this] (not strictly a requirement, but very, very nice to have)
   * An equivalent to http://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/ or a data-feed that can be used to recreate it.
   * A wiki for documenting how all these other parts of the workflow integrate.
 * Source browser
   * line number links
 * Revision control
   * commit notification to IRC
   * commit notification to email
     * RSS feed is probably sufficient
   * buildbot builds on trunk commits
   * buildbot builds on arbitrary branches
 * Revision control / ticket integration
   * automatic or easy association of branches with tickets
   * ability to close a ticket with a commit
   * reopen a ticket with a commit
   * automatically post a comment with a commit message

If some better tools come along that can do these better, we should use them instead.
