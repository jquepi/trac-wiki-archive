Botonomy LLC is a small software firm in the Philadelphia area. We help small teams solve large problems.

Our first application, [http://www.projectpipe.com/ ProjectPipe], is a hosted project management solution that provides midsize teams with everything that they need to manage IT projects. We have built our hosted application infrastructure atop Twisted, Nevow, PostgreSQL, and Jabber/XMPP. Twisted's multi-protocol support has been one of the key enablers of the unique technical architecture that we employ in our product offerings.

The core Twisted development team consistently demonstrates a strong commitment to delivering robust, high quality software. Twisted's documentation is accurate and concise, and the expertise and helpfulness of the larger developer community is second-to-none.

When evaluating the technologies on which you are staking your business, you need to evaluate both the code and the community that surrounds it. Twisted passes with flying colors in both regards.

At Reflexions Data, we provide custom development services for a wide variety of clients. We recently completed work on a project for a new client; the timeframe available required us to expedite every step of the development process. Twisted allowed us to quickly implement a custom client/server protocol with a wide variety of extra functionality for free.

The quality of the Twisted networking core is unmatched in the open- or closed-source arenas. Due largely to its asynchronous networking model, we were able to ensure our clients scalability needs would be met.

Our experiences with the Twisted developer community were top- notch; the turnaround time on questions posted to the developer mailing list was simply amazing. We were so pleased with the results of our first professional use of the Twisted core that we plan on investigating how we can make use of the other facets of the Twisted project.

At Masters of Branding we use Twisted as the networking core for all of our client and server RFID software. It was by far the easiest framework to develop with, debug under, and extend for our purposes to support protocols such as SOAP, HTTP, and Macromedia Flash-compatible XML Sockets. The API and event model are both very well thought out and has accommodated all of our networking needs from database-heavy server software on Linux to (py)OpenGL visualization applications on win32.

The ease and power of Python and Twisted really showed through when we took one of our applications developed in and for Linux and ported it to run as a Windows NT service in less than day. New users to the framework will not only be impressed by the power of the software, but also that the developer/user community responsible for it are incredibly helpful and often provide much better support in minutes or hours than you'll see from commercial shops given days or weeks.

= NASA =

My team is developing a modular application to integrate CAD/CAE/CAM tools and data and to enable collaboration among distributed teams of engineers working on NASA projects. We have selected Twisted as our framework because of its pluggable, asynchronous protocols, support for multiple interfaces and protocols per service, integration with PostgreSQL, and just generally excellent layered architecture.

= [http://adelux.c2a.fr/ Adelux] =

Adelux develops custom internet applications such as portals, network security tools, communication-related programs, and software that leverages other systems.

We discovered Twisted 10 months ago, and now it is a key element of our development strategy. We have successfully used Twisted on several projects, of very different problem domains.

We developed a highly scalable realtime application for customer support, which serves web-based clients as well as clients implemented in any of the many protocols supported by Twisted. Twisted was also used to develop targeted proxies for various applications supporting more than 15.000 users. Twisted handles the charge with no problem.

We intend to continue using Twisted on upcoming projects, especially since integrated support for databases and new services are being added very quickly.

We found Twisted to be powerful, comprehensible, well documented, and backed by a good helpful community. We'll use it on our next products for sure!

= [http://www.list.org/ Mailman] =

I wanted to test out some news/mail gatewaying for Mailman 2.1 but I didn't want to go through the hassle of actually connecting things up to a real news server, and I ''definitely'' didn't want to actually try to install inn or some nonsense (I'd like to do some other work this week :).

I wished I had something like Lib/smtpd.py in the Python distro for the server side of NNTP, then it dawned on me that I remember Moshe and crew saying that Twisted comes with a news server. Well, let's just see how easy it would be to hook up.

You guys have a big problem, because it was ''way'' too easy to do! How are you going to make the big consulting bucks? :)

Three commands and I had an nntp server with a single newsgroup that was featured enough to connect Mozilla to, and to point Mailman's gateway at and actually get messages flowing back and forth. Congratulations!

= MC-Foo and Ldaptor =

I was writing [http://mc-foo.sf.net/ MC Foo], a networked multiuser learning Ogg/MP3 jukebox application, in C, and was frustrated about the amount of time it took to debug. I decided I should use a higher-level language. I liked how Python felt, but had never written a single line of Python. I decided it was time to learn. Five hours later, the core of my application was rewritten in Python, using Twisted for main loop and networking. Another five hours later, I had replaced my oversimplistic line-based protocols with PB, the Twisted RPC protocol. Twisted has also enabled me to easily add features such as implicit persistence into MC Foo. And it even has nice GUI integration, allowing one to do sane networking in a GUI application.

Since then, I have created [http://ldaptor.bkbits.net/ Ldaptor], a pure-Python LDAP library, utilities and a web interface, as a data structure library, Twisted protocol and Twisted applications. The way how the web interface plugs in with the LDAP protocol handling still manages to amaze me.

The developer community behind Twisted is just great, and the IRC channel is a great source of information. All in all, I feel Twisted is one of the most interesting projects on the net.
