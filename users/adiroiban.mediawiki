I am using Twisted for implementing file transfer related software.

I am interested in the following Twisted components:

* core/internet/TCP/SSL

* FTP

* Conch SSH / SFTP. I also have an experimental embedded custom SCP process. 

* HTTP / HTTPS

* SMTP

* development tools

* documentation / code examples

* python.filepath - but I ended up implementing my own Twisted independent / os independent replacement.
