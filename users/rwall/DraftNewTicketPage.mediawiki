= Patch Upload =

This is a proposed checklist for inclusion on the
[/trac/attachment/ticket/1/?action=new ticket attachment upload page].

----

Please read this first:

 1. If you are submitting a patch:
    1. '''Read the [wiki:TwistedDevelopment#SubmittingaPatch patch guidelines].'''
    2. '''Keep patches as small as possible (<800 lines).''' This will make
       it easy for your change to be reviewed. For larger changes
       please contact Twisted developers first to discuss how your
       contribution can be broken into a series of tickets and small
       patches.
    3. '''Use a standard patch filename'''. All lowercase, no spaces,
       include ticket number, include a patch version number, .patch
       or .diff extension eg agent-howto-spelling-1234-1.patch
    4. '''Add the "review" keyword''' to the ticket after uploading your
       patch. This will add the ticket and your patch to the
       [report:15 review queue].
 2. If you are submitting an example or demonstration:
    1. Make it a '''[http://sscce.org/ Short, Self Contained, Correct Example]'''
    2. '''Include instructions''' showing how to run the example and the
       expected output.

And always '''add an explanatory comment to the ticket''', summarising
the purpose of your attachment.
