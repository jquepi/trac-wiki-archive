This is a page dedicated to short notes for the next release manager of Twisted.

For example, if you need a topfile changed in NEWS, or special things need to be done for the next release, put it here so that it's not lost.

'''Twisted 14.0'''

- Please change the NEWS entry for #454 to "twisted.internet.interfaces.IUDPTransport - and that interface's implementations in Twisted - now supports enabling broadcasting.", the one I merged didn't meet guidelines. -hawkowl
