In general, we want the word mark "Twisted" and the Twisted logos to be used with minimal restriction to refer to the Twisted project.

We do not want these trademarks to be used:

  * to refer to any other Python library
  * in a way that is misleading or that may imply endorsement by the Twisted project of unrelated modules, tools, documentation, or other resources

If you have any questions about trademark usage, please contact [mailto:trademarks@twistedmatrix.com trademarks@twistedmatrix.com].
