We need someone with a broadband Internet connection to provide hosting for one or more of the above machines. In order to avoid shipping boxes around, it would be ideal if the person providing the hardware could also arrange the hosting. This may not be possible, and so we will consider shipping arrangements as the need arises. Dedicated/colo bandwidth preferred (of course), but please don't hesitate to offer residential broadband (most of our buildslaves run on residential lines, after all)

UPS units would be a nice touch, but not required unless your power is very unreliable.

Virtual Machines (VMWare, etc) are very much welcome!
