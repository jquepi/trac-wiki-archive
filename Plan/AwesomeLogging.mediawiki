`twisted.python.log` needs some fixing up.

I'd like it to have a thing where there's a ring buffer of more detailed messages, and when a failure occurs it dumps that to a file, so there's some context for what was going on when there was an exception.

All messages logged by Twisted should have an identifiable key associated with them (an interface maybe?)

It would be great to have a built-in network logging abstraction.

All of these need to be fleshed out some more.
