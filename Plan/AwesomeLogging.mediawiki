We have a new awesome logging system in `twisted.python.logger` but not a lot of things are using it yet (it hasn't even been in a release!)

We should file some tickets to start moving ''all'' usage of `twisted.python.log` over to `twisted.python.logger`, so that users can start getting the benefits of the new, fancy system, and we can eventually deprecate and remove the old one.
