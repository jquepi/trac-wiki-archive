== Objective ==

To have Twisted available on Python 3.3 and newer, with the same functionality as is currently available on Python 2.x.

== Strategy ==

  * Single source - The result will be a version of Twisted that is source-compatible with Python 2.6, Python 2.7, and Python 3.3.
  * Test-driven - Following the standard Twisted development process, all changed code will be fully automatically unit tested.
  * Opportunistic - Where module dependencies (within Twisted) need to be ported to support porting of the high-priority modules, modules may be split so that only some of their contents need to be ported.

All other standard Twisted development practices apply.

== Details ==

  1. Bootstrap the testing system
    1. Port the non-reactor parts of trial necessary to run the tests for the non-reactor parts of trial
      1. Refactor the implementation to separate the reactor and non-reactor parts into separate source files
      1. Add more tests for uncovered functionality
      1. Get the non-reactor parts passing their own tests on Python 3.3 (alpha, until 3.3 is actually released)
  1. Test-driven port of the dependencies of the reactor features of trial
  1. Test-driven port of the reactor features of trial
  1. Test-driven port of the following modules (some of which may be dependencies of above steps):
    * twisted.cred
    * twisted.internet.defer
    * twisted.trial
    * twisted.internet.gireactor
    * twisted.internet.selectreactor
    * twisted.internet.pollreactor

    * twisted.protocols.basic
    * twisted.web
      * client
      * http
      * resource
      * server
      * http_headers
