= So, you want to contribute to Twisted? =

First, a few recommendations:
  * Hang out on IRC and ask questions
    * [irc://irc.freenode.net/twisted #twisted]
    * [irc://irc.freenode.net/twisted.web #twisted.web]
  * Search trac for tickets with the [/trac/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&keywords=%7Eeasy&order=priority 'Easy' keyword]. These are low-hanging fruit and are good for first-time contributors.

What you'll need:
  * [http://subversion.apache.org/ Subversion (SVN)] client
  * [/trac/register Register] with the site and create an account
  * A decent grasp of Twisted and what you intend to accomplish

== Just the Basics ==

This assumes you will be working on an existing open [/trac/report/ ticket].

  * Checkout a fresh copy of Twisted trunk. This is going to be your development branch.[[BR]]
    e.g. {{{svn co svn://svn.twistedmatrix.com/svn/Twisted/trunk MyTwistedTrunk}}}

  * Make your changes
    * You will '''need''' tests for your code
    * You will '''need''' docstrings
  * Run the '''''full''''' Twisted test suite and make sure your new tests pass along with entire suite: {{{trial twisted}}}
  * Create a patch:[[BR]]
  {{{svn diff -u > my-twisted-patch.patch}}}

  * Submit the patch and and attach it to the trac ticket.
  * Begin the [wiki:ReviewProcess Review process]. A core developer will review your changes and give you feedback. You respond to the feedback using the ticket, attaching further patches as necessary.
  * Once your patch is in good shape and approved, it will be accepted.
  * A core developer will create a new branch for your ticket: {{{description-1234}}}, where ''description'' is a summary and ''1234'' is the ticket #
  * The new branch will be merged to trunk and your contribution will be forever remembered.

== Next Steps ==

Twisted has a rigorous development process. Now that you have a basic idea of the overall process, you can continue reading about [wiki:ContributingToTwistedLabs#Prepare Contributing to Twisted]
