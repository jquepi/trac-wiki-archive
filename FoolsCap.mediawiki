"Foolscap" is the name for the next-generation RPC protocol, intended to replace Perspective Broker. It has been under development (on and off) by Brian Warner for several years.

Foolscap now lives on its own Trac, at http://foolscap.lothar.com/trac . Please visit there for downloads, source code, bugs, and documentation.
