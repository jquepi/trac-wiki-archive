This builder uses [https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv pyenv]-provided Pythons because its version of macOS includes an ancient version of OpenSSL.

pyenv downloads OpenSSL 1.0.2 and links {{{_ssl}}} against it on older macOS releases:

https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/b960f863ccf81e1311706b0976fde78e58141704/plugins/python-build/share/python-build/3.6.5#L2
https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/b960f863ccf81e1311706b0976fde78e58141704/plugins/python-build/bin/python-build#L1479-L1484

pyenv was chosen over [https://docs.brew.sh/ brew] because brew wants to take over /usr/local/bin, but other things have been installed there.

The build master's configuration assumes:

1. That Python 2.7.14 is installed ({{{pyenv install 2.7.14}}}) and aliased to {{{python}}} ({{{pyenv global 2.7.14}}})
2. That the {{{virtualenv}}} package is installed and runnable by {{{python -m virtualenv}}} (e.g., {{{python -m pip install --user virtualenv}}})
