Build slaves for generating coverage information have all the [wiki:ContinuousIntegration/TestSlaveConfiguration usual requirements] (with one restriction, BuildBot 0.7.12 or newer is required).  Additionally, these tools are required:

  * [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html gcov]
  * [http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php lcov]
  * [http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/ coverage.py]
